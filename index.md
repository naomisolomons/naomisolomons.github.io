My interests are, broadly, how quantum information differs from the classical world and how this can be harnessed for a useful advantage, particularly in computation. During my PhD, I studied Gaussian boson sampling, and during my postdoc I have been working on distributed quantum sensing. I am also currently interested in contextuality.

I grew up in Essex, in the UK, and did my undergrad at Durham University, then joined the Quantum Engineering CDT at the University of Bristol (now the [QIST CDT](https://www.qist-cdt.info/)). During my PhD I did an internship with [Riverlane](https://www.riverlane.com/) and worked part-time for [Duality Quantum Photonics](https://www.dualityqp.com/). Since May 2024 I have been in Paris in the [LIP6 QI group](https://naomisolomons.github.io/). You can download my CV [here](./Naomi_Solomons_CV.pdf).

To see a list of my papers, you can look at my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1DMjizQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). You can download my thesis [here](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/studentTheses/applications-of-gaussian-boson-sampling-in-graph-theory/). When I was writing my thesis, I also wrote a considerably longer 'annotated copy'. This is not peer-reviewed (and mostly not read by anyone other than myself), but contains extra notes that I wrote explaining concepts in more details or adding extra details I found interesting. You can download it [here](./memoirthesis.pdf). I hope someone else finds it useful!

I am interested in outreach and DEI. As a student I wrote several articles for [Physics World](https://physicsworld.com/author/naomi-solomons/).

You are welcome to get in touch -- if you have questions about any of my papers, if you want help with applications to a group or company I was with, if you are interested in collaborations, if you would like assistance organising an outreach project, or anything else. My email address is naomi.solomons@lip6.fr, or you can message me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/naomi-solomons-011510119/) or [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/naomisolomons.bsky.social) (I check the latter quite rarely).
